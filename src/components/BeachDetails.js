            What is defines a beautiful beach? For some, it's the whiteness of the sand and the clarity of the water. For others, it's the ruggedness of the coast and the power of the waves. For others, it's the beauty of the people sitting along the shore. When it comes to beaches, beauty is definitely in the eye of the beholder.
